# N4O Shosetsu Extensions

A collection of Shosetsu extensions that I've made as an extra accompanion for the upstream Shosetsu extensions.

It was originally a fork of the upstream repo but since they moved to GitLab, I decided to detach the fork and remove the upstream extension from this repository so there is no duplicates.

You can report any problem in the Issues tab, you can also try to request an extension (Depends on how hard it is to implement).

You can also try to contact me via Discord: **N4O#8868**

### Specials Info
1. Hellping<br />
   This extension use a custom API made specifically for Shosetsu since the website design is so broken and hard to parse. See [`extras`](https://github.com/noaione/shosetsu-extensions/tree/dev/extras) folder for more info.
2. CClaw Translations<br />
   Part of this extension use the custom API. See [`extras`](https://github.com/noaione/shosetsu-extensions/tree/dev/extras) folder for more info.

## Contributing

Contribution is allowed, as long as it is not available in the upstream repository because it is useless.

Please make sure to test the extension using my fork of [extension-tester](https://github.com/noaione/shosetsu-ext-tester)
